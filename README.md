## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on becoming an AI/Cyber Security researcher. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything... Still in school.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool projects that interest me or give me valuable experience.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about space or AI and we can have a long fruitful conversation.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Almost every galaxy has a black hole at the center... including the milky way! When we *eventually* crash into andromeda (next closest galaxy) our two black holes will likely create a supermassive black hole!
